TO DO:
* Figure out how to deploy to Fitz
* does Fitz have multiple cores (to speed data loading)?
* Figure out how to word wrap text in sidebar
* Landing page with animated gif of pressures over time? or static map?
* reactive captions on globes to indicate which stressors are included in selected category? nah that's OK
* tab with a few select species, to walk through species range, stressor ranges, and resulting impacted footprint
